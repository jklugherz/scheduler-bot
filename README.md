# scheduler-bot

SchedulerBot is a SlackBot that schedules meetings with other Slack users in Google Calendar. We used API.AI (now dialogflow) for the bot's natural language processing abilities. Additionally, this bot required integration with Google OAuth and Google's Calendar API.

Next steps: when a user asks to meet with a group of people at a certain time, calculate any conflicts within other group members and suggest five new times (on business days) that work for each invitee.
